# code_samples

Each folder contains the code sample and an compressed copy of that sample.

1. A simple patch to a Drupal contrib module (auto_entitylabel), for trimming whitespace in automatic labels (https://www.drupal.org/node/2120055) -- 2015.
2. MySQL queries I wrote for a few cases when we need to pull data or find info that's difficult to get at through the Drupal 7 admin UI, and also one query for migrate data from a textarea field to a text field -- 2013-2015.
3. Script to help with data restoration on one of our legacy PHP (v4.3.2) platforms (I left it completely as-is from 2014 *except* to remove some identifying paths/names/titles/etc., all of which are indicated with "redacted" hehe) -- 2014.
4. A map tool that illustrated supporter participation in a "virtual rally" (I've included an XML file of sample data) -- ca. 2011-2012.
5. A tool with which supporters could add photos of their own to the organization's Flickr photostream -- ca. 2011-2012.
